# Work-Day-Scheduler
The goal of this assignment was to create a work scheduler with the following requirements: 

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

The rows should display the proper color based on the hour of the day, save each task to the local storage, and continue to display said task even after refreshing the page by pulling from the local storage. We were also tasked with ensuring that the time elements worked with moment.js.
